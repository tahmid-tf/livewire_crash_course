# 🚀 Laravel Livewire Learning Log

Welcome to my journey through **Laravel Livewire**—a modern framework for building dynamic interfaces without leaving the comfort of Laravel. This repository documents the foundational concepts I’ve explored so far.

---

## 📦 1. Installing Livewire & Passing Data to Blade Files

- Installed via Composer: `composer require livewire/livewire`
- Published assets and included scripts in Blade layouts.
- Passed data to views using component `public` properties and `render()` method.

---

## 🔁 2. Livewire Data Binding

- Implemented real-time synchronization between UI and server state using `wire:model`.
- Used for inputs, checkboxes, and dropdowns to reflect backend data seamlessly.

---

## 🧱 3. Livewire Components

- Created reusable Livewire components using `php artisan make:livewire ComponentName`
- Utilized lifecycle hooks like `mount()` and `render()`.
- Composed components for a clean and maintainable frontend architecture.

---

## 📝 4. Web Form with Validation

- Built interactive forms with Livewire, handling state and submission.
- Used `validate()` method within the component for real-time validation.
- Displayed validation feedback directly in the UI.

---

## ⚡ 5. Smooth Navigation Like JS Frameworks

- Achieved dynamic page updates without full reloads.
- Used Livewire’s magic to mimic SPA-like navigation.
- No custom JS—Livewire handled transitions, form states, and more!
